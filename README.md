# Mathematics Of Deep Learning Parallel Curricula
This repository contains my implementations to the algorithms covered in the Parallel Curricula of the Mathematics of Deep Learning class in the Spring semester of 2018. The main goal of the semester is to understand [Alpha Go](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/).

I am currently working on implementing a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game (so that there are relatively small amount of implementation details) using (1) Evolutionary algorithms: (a) Brute Force search of the game tree; (b) Alpha-Beta Pruning of the game tree; (2) Reinforcement learning based on a learned value function.
